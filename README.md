# ZNEUS @ FIIT

This repository contains supporting materials for the subject ZNEUS (@ FIIT STU).

It is a very important repository, you will find here the assignments prepared for you, for the first 4 weeks of the semester.

### Feedback
- If you find any inconvenience or errors in the notebooks, just let us know (or make a pull request)...
- Any recommendations to the subject + topics = let us know...

### Python
We use _Python 3.7_+ compatible code in these notebooks, however it may work with older versions.
We assume that you have seen Python code before. If you have not, Week 1 is a quick dive-in course that may help.
You should learn the basics as soon as possible (e.g. [W3Schools tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp)).

##  Week 1
This is a warm-up week and for some of you the __lecture is after your seminar__, so we'll take it easy on you. 
All you have to do is to prepare your computing environment. 
If you have never worked with Python, this is a good chance for you to start - you'll be using it a lot during this semester (or not, if you prefer C++).
We have prepared a few simple tasks that you can find in the directory "week_1" - Jupyter Notebook.
If you know all of that already, well ...then, congratulations ;)

But still... the attendance of the seminars is mandatory.

## Week 3
All hands on board!

This week, you are going to implement a simple multilayer perceptron with its feed forward function.
In the notebook, there are already prepared base classes and structures. 
Finish all the forward functions and run the visualization/print cells.
Follow the instructions in the notebook.

Of course - you don't have to do it before the seminar... 
As stated during the lecture and seminars, this is your work for the upcoming week's seminars.
Also - don't forget to refresh your memory about matrix operations and perceptron's architecture.

Good luck
